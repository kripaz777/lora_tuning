        "Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models developed using the same research and technology behind the Gemini models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemma excel at various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models undergo pre-training on vast text corpora in a self-supervised manner, allowing them to learn general knowledge, such as statistical word relationships. They can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform specialized tasks like sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since LLMs contain billions of parameters, full fine-tuning is often unnecessary, as fine-tuning datasets are significantly smaller than pre-training datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is an efficient fine-tuning technique that minimizes the number of trainable parameters by freezing the model’s original weights and integrating a small set of additional weights. This approach accelerates training, reduces memory usage, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred megabytes), all while preserving output quality."
